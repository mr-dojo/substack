# Principles

Context is infrastructure. Treat it that way.

Own your context layer. If it lives in a platform's memory, they control it — not you. Plain text files you version-control are the only durable solution.

Portability is non-negotiable. Any context system that doesn't work across Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and whatever ships next year has already failed.

Soul is formation. Context is information. Soul changes slowly; context accumulates and gets pruned. Don't confuse them.

Pruning is maintenance, not loss. A smaller set of current, relevant context files outperforms a large set of stale ones.

Compounding is the point. Context built over months is qualitatively different from context built over days. The system gets more useful the longer you use it.

AI is a thinking partner, not a task executor. The quality of that partnership depends on shared context.

The simplest system that works is the right system. Folders of text files are enough.
