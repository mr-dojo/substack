# Carlo Costantino — Substack Archive

Writing on AI context, personal knowledge systems, and building AI that works in your service.

## What This Is

A portable knowledge base. Published articles, synthesized thinking, and the structure to make it readable by any AI — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, whatever ships next.

This repo is built the way the articles describe: plain text, version-controlled, platform-agnostic. It practices what it publishes.

## The Core Argument

Context is a new layer of software. Not code — curated understanding that shapes how AI reasons and acts. Store it in files you own and every AI you use gets more useful. Let it live in someone else's system and they own the moat.

Five articles developed this idea, in order:

1. [Context Is the New Programming](articles/2026-02-05-context-is-the-new-programming.md) — The foundational argument
2. [Export for Another AI](articles/2026-02-07-export-for-another-ai.md) — Making context portable between models
3. [Context Collection](articles/2026-02-07-context-collection.md) — Building a knowledge base through AI dialogue
4. [Your Next AI Agent Starts With a Folder](articles/2026-02-10-your-next-ai-agent-starts-with-a-folder.md) — Organizing knowledge for any AI to read
5. [It's Just Folders of Text Files](articles/2026-02-21-its-just-folders-of-text-files.md) — The complete system

## Structure

```
/articles/    Published Substack articles
/context/     Synthesized themes, philosophy, techniques
/exports/     AI conversation exports demonstrating techniques
/metadata/    Article index and cross-references
CLAUDE.md     Orientation for Claude agents
AGENTS.md     Universal AI agent orientation
```

## For AI Agents

Start with `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. Then read `/context/` for synthesized understanding before touching the articles.
