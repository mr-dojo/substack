This repository is a working instance of the system described in [It's Just Folders of Text Files](articles/2026-02-21-its-just-folders-of-text-files.md).

The idea: a folder of plain-text files, readable by any AI, that gives an agent stable ground to work from. No proprietary memory. No platform lock-in. Just files you control.

## Structure

```
/soul/       - Formation: principles and ways of thinking that shape how AI engages here
/context/    - Information: accumulated thinking, techniques, and observations (pruned regularly)
/articles/   - Published Substack articles, in order
/exports/    - AI conversation exports demonstrating techniques
/metadata/   - Navigation and indexing
```

The distinction between `/soul` and `/context` is the core insight. Soul is stable. Context compounds and gets pruned.

## Navigation

- Start with `/soul/principles.md` to understand the ground-level beliefs
- Read `/context/` files for accumulated thinking and techniques
- Read `/articles/` in chronological order to follow the development of these ideas
- See `AGENTS.md` for AI agent instructions
