# Philosophical Foundations

Core beliefs and principles underlying Carlo's approach to AI and knowledge systems.

## On Context

Context is what turns a smart person into a useful one -- and the same applies to AI. A new layer of software development is emerging: curating context that shapes how AI understands and acts. Where traditional programming writes instructions for computers to execute, context programming curates understanding for AI to reason from. AI agents don't need fancy formats; they need organized information. The simplest version of personal AI might be the one that already exists: a well-organized folder of plain text files.

## On Ownership

Every major AI company wants to own your context layer because context creates lock-in. Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Apple are all racing to capture personal context into proprietary systems. The alternative is personal context sovereignty: your context, your files, your control. A folder you control inverts the platform relationship. The architecture doesn't change based on who can see it -- the access controls do. Public shelf for published thinking, private vault for proprietary data.

## On AI Relationships

AI is a thinking partner, not just a task executor. The quality of that partnership depends on shared context. Collecting context is how you invest in that partnership -- every document saved represents thinking already done, and the understanding compounds. The stateless nature of AI conversations is a solvable problem: store context portably, and every AI you use gets more useful.

## On Knowledge

Knowledge compounds when organized and maintained. Reading plus AI dialogue produces processed insight that reading alone doesn't. But context has a lifecycle -- information gets stale, decisions change. Treat context like a product that requires maintenance. The same knowledge base can power every AI tool you use, creating leverage. Your mental models can become someone else's starting point when organized as portable context.
