# Evolution of Thinking

How the ideas in this repository developed, in order.

## Week 1 — The Problem (Feb 5)

Started with a felt frustration: every AI conversation starts from zero. The thinking done in one session doesn't carry forward. The question became whether that was a product limitation or an architectural one. Concluded it was architectural — and solvable.

Named the solution "context programming": curating understanding for AI to reason from, distinct from writing code for computers to execute. Anthropic's Constitutional AI was the clearest example — a plain-text document shaping AI behavior at scale.

## Week 1 — The Techniques (Feb 7)

Two practical methods emerged from daily use: "export for another AI" (asking a model to package what it knows for portability) and "context collection" (read → discuss → export → save). Both were responses to the same problem: how do you preserve processed thinking across sessions and platforms?

## Week 2 — The Architecture (Feb 10)

Scaled from technique to system. A folder with orientation files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) becomes context for any AI agent on any platform. The insight: you don't need a product to build this. You need a folder.

## Week 3 — The Distinction (Feb 21)

The most important refinement: soul is not context. Soul is formation — the stable layer of principles, values, and ways of thinking that changes slowly. Context is information — the accumulating, prunable history of decisions and documents. Conflating them produces a system that neither grounds behavior nor updates well.

Also: pruning is not deletion. It's maintenance. A well-pruned context base at 6 weeks is more valuable than a bloated one, because every file in it is still true.
