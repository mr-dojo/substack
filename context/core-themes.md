# Core Themes

Recurring patterns observed across the writing and daily use of the system.

## Context as Infrastructure

Every major AI company is racing to capture personal context because context is the moat. The practical implication: if you don't own your context layer, someone else does. This theme appears in every article and gets more concrete over time — from abstract argument (Feb 5) to working folder structure (Feb 21).

## The Simplicity Surprise

The expected answer to "how do I make AI work better for me" is a product, a subscription, an integration. The actual answer keeps turning out to be a folder of text files. This surprises people every time, which suggests the real barrier is conceptual, not technical.

## Compounding as the Core Value Proposition

A well-maintained context base at 6 weeks is qualitatively different from one at 6 days. The system rewards consistency. This is also why pruning matters — stale context breaks the compounding effect by introducing noise.

## Soul/Context as a Genuine Distinction

The most durable insight from this body of work: soul (formation, principles, values) and context (information, history, decisions) are different kinds of things that require different handling. Soul should be stable and declarative. Context should accumulate and get pruned. Systems that conflate them work poorly over time.
