# Core Themes

Recurring ideas and patterns across Carlo's writing.

## Context as Infrastructure

Context is what turns a smart person (or AI) into a useful one. Every major AI company is racing to capture, structure, and control personal context because context is the product and memory is the moat. Carlo argues that context programming -- curating understanding for AI to reason from -- is a new layer of software development alongside traditional code. Anthropic's Constitution demonstrates this at scale: a plain-text document that shapes AI behavior by providing foundational context, not executable instructions.

## Portability & Sovereignty

Your context should live in files you control, not inside any platform's proprietary memory system. When context lives in Google's ecosystem, Google controls it. When it lives in ChatGPT's memory, OpenAI holds it. A folder of plain-text files inverts that relationship: use Claude today, Codex tomorrow, whatever ships next month. The context doesn't change. Carlo calls this "personal context sovereignty" -- your context, your files, your control. Over 20,000 software projects already demonstrate this pattern with CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files.

## AI as Thinking Partner

AI is not just a tool for tasks -- it's a thinking partner. The quality of that partnership depends on shared context. Reading plus AI dialogue gives processed insight that reading alone doesn't. The "export for another AI" technique captures that processing in portable form, preserving preferences, ongoing threads, decisions made, and context that shaped the conversation.

## Knowledge Compounding

Context compounds over time. Each document of refined understanding becomes context for processing the next piece of information. A knowledge base that starts with a few articles grows into an accumulating worldview. Context creates leverage: write it once, use it everywhere, across every AI tool. Context also has a lifecycle -- it gets stale and requires maintenance, like any product.
