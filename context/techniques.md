# Techniques & Methods

Practical approaches documented across articles.

## Export for Another AI

At the end of a conversation (or in the middle), say: "Export everything you know about this topic for another AI." The model produces something dense, complete, and structured for continuation -- including preferences, ongoing threads, decisions made, and context that shaped the conversation. Use cases: portability between platforms, branching conversations without losing context, and creating checkpoints of productive sessions.

## Context Collection

Read something interesting, paste it into a conversation with AI, discuss it, then export the refined understanding. The saved document contains what the original didn't: your interpretation, connections to other knowledge, conclusions reached, questions resolved. Each document builds on previous ones, accumulating a worldview one conversation at a time.

## Reading with AI

Paste source material into a conversation with AI. Ask what it means, how it connects to other things, what you're missing. The model pushes back, makes connections, helps think through implications. By the end, you understand the material differently -- deeper and more connected. This is the input stage of context collection.

## Portable Storage

Store context in platform-agnostic formats (Markdown files, plain text) in locations accessible to multiple AI tools (Google Drive, GitHub). Connect Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other tools to the same knowledge base. Same context, different interfaces. Git provides version control so nothing gets lost. The folder structure itself becomes the knowledge base -- organized with clear file names, thematic grouping, and a table of contents.

## Folder as Agent Context

Organize published thinking, frameworks, and institutional knowledge in a structured repository folder. Include orientation files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) that tell AI agents what the collection covers and how to navigate it. Point any AI agent at the folder and it reads every file, maps relationships, and reasons from the foundation. Works for articles, case studies, research papers, competitive analyses -- any organized body of knowledge in plain text.

## Pruning

Regularly review context files and delete what's no longer true, relevant, or current. Stale context is worse than no context — it misleads. After 6 weeks of daily use, expect to prune roughly 20-25% of accumulated files. The goal is a smaller, denser, more accurate set — not a complete archive. Treat pruning as routine maintenance, not as losing work.

## Soul vs. Context Separation

Keep two distinct layers. Soul holds formation: principles, values, ways of thinking — the stable ground that shapes how AI engages with you. Context holds information: decisions made, documents saved, history accumulated. Write soul files as declarative statements. Write context files as dated records. Read soul before every session; prune context regularly. The separation is what makes the system work long-term.
