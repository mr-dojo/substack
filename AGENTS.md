# AI Agent Orientation

<!-- Universal orientation file for AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Codex, and others) -->

## Before You Do Anything Else

Read `/soul/principles.md`. It is short. It shapes everything else.

## Repository Owner

Carlo Costantino — writer focused on AI context management and personal knowledge systems.

## What This Repository Is

A working instance of a personal context system. Not documentation about the system — the system itself. The articles explain the ideas; the folder structure demonstrates them.

## Structure

```
/soul/       - Formation: stable principles that shape how to engage here (read first)
/context/    - Information: accumulated thinking, techniques, observations (pruned regularly)
/articles/   - Published Substack articles in chronological order
/exports/    - AI conversation exports demonstrating techniques
/metadata/   - Navigation and indexing
```

## How to Navigate

1. Read `/soul/principles.md` — the stable ground
2. Read `/context/` files for accumulated thinking on specific topics
3. Reference `/articles/` for the full development of any idea
4. Use `/metadata/article-index.md` to find articles by theme

## Key Concepts

- **Soul vs. context**: soul is formation (stable), context is information (accumulates, gets pruned)
- **Portability**: this system works with any AI on any platform because it's plain text
- **Compounding**: the system gets more useful over time as context accumulates and gets refined
- **Sovereignty**: files you control, not platform memory someone else owns
