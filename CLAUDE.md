# Orientation for Claude

<!-- This file provides context for Claude AI agents reading this repository -->

## Before You Do Anything Else

Read `/soul/principles.md`. It is the stable ground for this repository.

## Who This Is

Carlo Costantino - Writer exploring AI, context management, and personal knowledge systems.

## What This Repository Is

A working instance of a personal context system — not just articles about the system, but the system itself in use. The structure demonstrates the ideas the articles describe.

## Navigation

- `/soul/` - Formation: stable principles that shape how to engage (read first)
- `/context/` - Accumulated thinking, techniques, and observations (pruned regularly)
- `/articles/` - Published Substack articles (chronologically organized)
- `/exports/` - AI conversation exports demonstrating techniques
- `/metadata/` - Indexes and navigation tools

## How to Use This

Read `/soul/principles.md` first. Then use `/context/` files to understand accumulated thinking on specific topics. Reference `/articles/` for full development of any idea. The soul/context distinction is the core insight — soul is stable formation, context is accumulating information.
