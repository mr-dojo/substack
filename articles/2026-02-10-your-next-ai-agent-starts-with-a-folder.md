# Your Next AI Agent Starts With a Folder

*Carlo Costantino | February 10, 2026*

Picture a shared folder on your company's network. Inside are 40 documents: strategy memos, quarterly reviews, competitive analyses, project briefs, customer research. Every document organized by topic. Every version saved. A table of contents at the top that explains what the collection covers and how to navigate it.

Now picture handing that folder to a new hire on their first day. "Read this. This is how we think. This is what we know. This is how we got here." By the end of the week, that person can have an informed conversation about almost anything the company has worked on. They don't know everything. But they have context. And context is what turns a smart person into a useful one.

AI agents work the same way. You hand them a folder of well-organized documents, and they read every file, map the relationships between ideas, and start reasoning from what's actually there. The difference is speed. A human takes a week. An AI agent takes about 30 seconds.

The technology world already has a name for this kind of folder. It's called a repository. A repo. And software developers have been using repos to give AI agents context for years. Today, over 20,000 software projects include plain-text instruction files that teach AI agents how their project works: what to build, what to test, what conventions to follow. These files aren't code. They're written in plain English. The agents read them the same way they read anything else.

The question I keep coming back to: why are we only doing this for code?

## The Folder Everyone Already Has

If you run a business, you already have the raw material. Your Google Drive, your SharePoint, your Notion workspace. It's full of the thinking your organization has done. Strategic plans. Sales playbooks. Product roadmaps. Customer insights. Post-mortems. The knowledge is there. It's just scattered across platforms and buried in formats that AI tools can't easily reach.

Every major AI company is trying to solve this problem by building connectors. Google connects Gemini to your Gmail and Photos. OpenAI builds memory systems that learn from months of ChatGPT conversations. Anthropic connects Claude to Google Drive and Slack. Each company wants to be the one that captures your context and keeps it on their platform. That's the business model: the more they know about you, the harder it is to leave.

But there's a simpler approach. Take your published thinking, your frameworks, your best institutional knowledge, and organize it in one place. A folder with structure. A table of contents. Clear file names. Plain text.

In the software world, that folder lives on GitHub and every major AI agent already knows how to read it. You point the agent at the folder and say "understand this." Done. No special integration. No paid connector. No API. A URL.

## Why This Works

The reason this works is that AI agents don't need fancy formats. They need organized information. When a software developer puts a file called AGENTS.md in their project folder, they're writing a plain-English guide that tells the AI agent what it needs to know about the project. Think of it as an orientation document for a machine. Anthropic's Claude uses an equivalent file called CLAUDE.md. OpenAI's Codex reads AGENTS.md automatically before it starts working. The agent shows up, reads the orientation packet, and gets to work.

Anthropic's engineering team published a detailed breakdown of this approach. They call it "context engineering," and they describe it as the natural evolution of how we work with AI. The core principle: give the agent the smallest, most relevant set of information and it will perform better than if you dump everything on it at once. Curate the folder. Organize the files. Write clear headers. The agent does the rest.

A research team studying this trend analyzed 466 software projects that use these orientation files. They found five distinct approaches to providing context: describing what things are, prescribing what to do, prohibiting what to avoid, explaining why decisions were made, and setting conditional rules. Different projects, different needs, same format. Plain text in a folder.

And just a few weeks ago, GitHub launched a feature that lets you assign AI agents directly to project folders. You can tag @Claude or @Codex in a comment, and the agent picks up all the context from that folder automatically. The folder is the common ground. The agent is interchangeable.

## Beyond Code: What If the Folder Contained Your Expertise?

This is where it gets interesting for anyone who isn't a software developer.

Say you're a consultant who's published 40 articles on supply chain strategy over the past two years. Those articles live on a blog or behind a paywall. If a client wanted an AI assistant that understood your perspective, they'd have to copy and paste individual articles into a chat window. That context disappears when the conversation ends.

Now imagine those same 40 articles organized in a folder on GitHub. Each article is a plain text file. They're grouped by theme. There's a table of contents at the top that explains who you are and what the collection covers.

Anyone can give that folder to an AI agent. "Read this consultant's entire body of work, then help me apply their frameworks to my situation." The agent reads all 40 articles in seconds and reasons from that foundation. Your mental models become someone else's starting point. Your years of expertise become portable context that works with any AI tool.

This works for more than just articles. A design firm could organize their case studies. A policy institute could organize their research papers. A retail company could organize their customer insights and competitive analyses. A law firm could organize their precedent research. Any organized body of knowledge, in plain text, in a structured folder, becomes an instant knowledge base for any AI agent.

Rick Hightower, an engineer who led AI development at a Fortune 100 financial services company, already built a system that lets AI agents search through folders of documentation and code. He runs four different AI agents simultaneously, all reading from the same knowledge base. His description of the work: "context engineering for AI agents." The knowledge lives in one place. Any agent can access it. You're never locked into a single tool.

## You Own the Folder

This is the part that matters for anyone thinking about long-term strategy.

When you put your context inside Google's ecosystem, Google controls it. When you build up months of conversation history inside ChatGPT, OpenAI holds that context. When you connect your Drive to Claude, Anthropic mediates the access. Each platform benefits from making it painful to leave.

A folder you control inverts that relationship. Your published thinking, your frameworks, your institutional knowledge. It lives in a format that every major AI tool can read. You can use Claude today and Codex tomorrow and whatever ships next month. The context doesn't change. The folder doesn't move. Only the agent reading it changes.

For individuals, this means your expertise stays portable. For businesses, this means your institutional knowledge doesn't get trapped inside one vendor's ecosystem.

## Public Shelf, Private Vault

There's an obvious question: if you organize your best thinking in a public folder, aren't you just giving it away?

The answer depends on what you're organizing.

Published articles, conference talks, public frameworks, open research. This is already public. Putting it in an organized folder doesn't give away anything new. It just makes it more useful. It's your public bookshelf. Anyone can browse. And when they hand that shelf to an AI agent, your thinking reaches further than any blog post could on its own.

Proprietary data, internal strategy, customer information, competitive analysis. That stays private. A private folder, a private repo, a gated system. Same structure. Different access.

The architecture doesn't change based on who can see it. The access controls do.

## The Simplest Version of Personal AI

We keep building complicated systems to make AI understand us. Memory layers. Connector protocols. Retrieval pipelines. Vector databases. Some of these are genuinely useful for specific problems.

But the simplest version might be the one that already exists. A well-organized folder of plain text files. Readable by every major AI agent on the market. Portable across platforms. Version-controlled so nothing gets lost. Owned by you.

Software developers figured this out first because they already lived in folders. Over 20,000 of them are already using plain-text files to give AI agents the context they need. Academics are studying the patterns. Anthropic calls it context engineering. GitHub is building infrastructure around it.

The rest of us have the same opportunity. We just need to organize the folder.
