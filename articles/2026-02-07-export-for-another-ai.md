# Export for Another AI

I found a simple technique that changed how I use AI. Ask the model to export everything it knows for another AI.

## The Technique

At the end of a conversation (or in the middle), I say: "Export everything you know about this topic for another AI."

The model knows what another model needs. It captures the spirit of the conversation along with relevant details, structured for continuation.

## Why It Works

AIs know how to talk to AIs. When I ask for an export for another model, I get something dense, complete, and structured for continuation.

The model includes preferences, ongoing threads, decisions made, context that shaped the conversation. It embodies the conversation.

## How I Use It

**Portability.** I migrated my mom from ChatGPT to Claude. Before we switched, I asked ChatGPT to export everything it knew about her. Projects, preferences, how she likes to communicate, what she does and doesn't like. When we opened Claude, I dropped in that document. Claude immediately understood the relationship. No cold start.

**Branching.** Mid-conversation, I'll have a thought I want to explore without derailing the current thread. I ask for an export, open a new chat, paste it in. Now I have a branch with full context of where I was.

**Checkpoints.** End of a productive conversation, I export. That document goes into my project folder. Next time I start a conversation on that topic, I have the context ready.

## The Bigger Picture

This solves the lock-in problem. My context lives in documents, not inside any platform's memory system. Any model can read them. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, local models. The context travels with me.

I'm building a portable knowledge base, one conversation at a time.

## What I Say

"Export everything from this conversation for another AI."

I save the output somewhere. Use it next time I start a related conversation. Any AI I use gets more useful because it has my context.
