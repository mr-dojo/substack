# Context Collection

**Published:** February 07, 2026

I read something interesting. An article, a document, a thread. I paste it into a conversation with AI. We discuss it. I ask questions. The model pushes back, makes connections, helps me think through implications.

By the end, I understand the material differently than when I started. Deeper. More connected to other things I know.

Then I export that conversation for another AI. That export becomes a document in my collection.

## What Context Collection Means

Reading alone gives me information. Reading plus AI dialogue gives me processed insight. The export captures that processing.

The document I save contains what the original article didn't have: my interpretation, connections to other things I've learned, conclusions I've reached, questions I resolved along the way. It's mine now.

These documents build on each other. My refined understanding of one article becomes context when I'm processing the next. I'm accumulating a worldview, one conversation at a time.

## Why This Matters Now

Every major AI company is racing to capture personal context. Google announced "Personal Intelligence" for Gemini. Anthropic shipped Claude Co-work with desktop file access. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health to consolidate medical records. Apple is sitting on more personal data than anyone, waiting for models small enough to run on device.

Context is the product. Memory is the moat. Whoever owns your context layer owns your AI relationship.

I'd rather own it myself.

## How I Collect Context

**Read with AI.** I paste in what I'm trying to understand. We have a conversation. I ask what it means, how it connects, what I'm missing.

**Export the thinking.** When the conversation produces clarity, I ask the AI to export everything for another AI. That output captures the refined understanding.

**Store portably.** I keep everything in Google Drive. Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor all connect to it. Same knowledge base, different interfaces. I'm working toward GitHub for better version control.

**Build on it.** Next time I'm processing something related, I bring the previous documents in. The AI has the context of what I've already figured out. We go deeper.

## The Shift

I used to think about AI as a tool for tasks. Now I think about it as a thinking partner. The quality of that partnership depends on shared context.

Collecting context is how I invest in that partnership. Every document I save represents thinking I've already done. The understanding compounds.

Most people let their context live inside platforms they don't control. ChatGPT's memory. Claude's projects. Proprietary systems that don't talk to each other.

I keep mine in files. Portable. Readable. Mine.
